          ## How to load and use these Docker images locally
          
          1. Download the Docker image tar files from the GitHub Actions artifacts
          
          2. Load the images into your local Docker:
          ```bash
          docker load -i thingsboard-*.tar
          ```
          
          3. Verify the images are loaded:
          ```bash
          docker images | grep thingsboard
          ```
          
          4. Run the ThingsBoard container:
          ```bash
          docker run -it -p 9090:9090 -p 1883:1883 -p 5683:5683/udp thingsboard/tb-postgres
          ```
          
          Or use with docker-compose by referencing the local image.
          
          ## Note
          These images are built without pushing to Docker Hub, so they can only be used locally
          after loading them with `docker load`.
